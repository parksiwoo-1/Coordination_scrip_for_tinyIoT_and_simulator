# Coordinator Script for tinyIoT and device simulator

## Overview
This project provides:
- **Device simulators** for sending arbitrary temperature and humidity data to a tinyIoT server  
- A **coordinator script** to control and manage all processes  

The simulators follow the **oneM2M standard** and support both **HTTP** and **MQTT** protocols for data transmission.  

## File Structure
- `coordinator.py` – Main script to control the tinyIoT server and simulators  
- `simulator.py` – Temperature & Humidity sensor simulator (It is possible to add sensors to suit the user’s situation.)
- `config_coord.py`- Global configuration values (coordiantion.py)    
- `config_sim.py` – Global configuration values (simulator.py)  
- `test_data_temp.csv` – Temperature CSV data  
- `test_data_humid.csv` – Humidity CSV data  

## Features
- **Integrated control** with `coordination.py`  
- **Temperature and humidity simulation**
- **Protocols**: Choose between **HTTP** or **MQTT**    
- **Modes**  
  - `csv`: Sends data from CSV files in sequence  
  - `random`: Generates random data within configured ranges  
- **Automatic registration**: Create oneM2M AE/CNT resources with `--Registration` option  

## Environment
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS  
- **Language**: Python 3.8+  
- **IoT**: [tinyIoT](https://github.com/seslabSJU/tinyIoT)

NAME
       coordination.py - control and execution script coordinating tinyIoT server and device simulators

SYNOPSIS
       python3 coordination.py

DESCRIPTION
       coordination.py runs the tinyIoT server and sequentially launches the temperature simulator
       (simulator_temp.py) and humidity simulator (simulator_humid.py) to control the overall IoT simulation
       environment. It checks the server's responsiveness, detects whether each simulator is running properly, and
       safely terminates all processes in case of failure.

FUNCTIONALITY
       - Start the tinyIoT server and wait for its response.
       - Check if the server response is valid, terminate on failure.
       - Launch the temperature and humidity simulators with specified settings (protocol, mode, frequency, registration).
       - Confirm that each simulator is running properly.
       - Perform graceful shutdown on KeyboardInterrupt input during execution.

OPTIONS
       coordination.py does not take its own options; simulator parameters are hardcoded and passed internally:

       --protocol
              Specify the data transfer protocol (http or mqtt).

       --mode
              Select the type of data to send (csv or random).

       --frequency
              Set the data transfer interval in seconds.

       --registration
              Specify whether to create AE and CNT resources (1 = create, 0 = skip).

NAME
       simulator_temp.py - device simulator that emulates a temperature sensor and sends data to tinyIoT via oneM2M

SYNOPSIS
       python3 simulator_temp.py --protocol {http|mqtt} --mode {csv|random} --frequency N (seconds) --registration [0|1]

DESCRIPTION
       simulator_temp.py simulates a temperature sensor by generating sensor data at specified intervals and sending
       it as oneM2M-compliant ContentInstance messages. Both HTTP and MQTT protocols are supported, with data
       transmitted either from a CSV file or generated randomly.

       AE (Application Entity) and CNT (Container) resources can optionally be registered on the server.

OPTIONS
       --protocol {http|mqtt}
              Selects the transfer protocol. http uses REST API, mqtt sends data via MQTT broker.

       --mode {csv|random}
              Determines the data source. csv reads from a prepared CSV file, random generates values based on
              predefined profiles.

       --frequency N
              Specifies the interval in seconds between transmissions.

       --registration 0|1
              Controls whether AE and CNT resources are created on the server (1 = create, 0 = skip).

FUNCTIONALITY
       - Validates HTTP connectivity if protocol is http.
       - For MQTT, handles broker connection and disconnection.
       - Registers AE and CNT resources if registration is set to 1.
       - Sends sequential CSV data or random values depending on mode.
       - For HTTP, checks POST result and verifies storage via `/la` when necessary.
       - Retries on errors; terminates after repeated failures.

FILES
       config.py
              Defines parameters such as server settings, transmission frequency, file paths, and error thresholds.

       mqtt_client.py
              Implements oneM2M-compliant MQTT client for message transmission.

       TEMP_CSV (config.TEMP_CSV)
              Path to the CSV file used in csv mode.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       No environment variables are used; all settings are defined in config.py.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful completion.

       1      Exited due to configuration errors, server connection failure, data file errors, AE/CNT registration
              failure, or repeated transmission failures.

MQTT_CLIENT.PY(3)                           IoT MQTT Module Manual                           MQTT_CLIENT.PY(3)

NAME
       mqtt_client.py - client module for performing MQTT communication based on oneM2M structure

SYNOPSIS
       from mqtt_client import MqttOneM2MClient

DESCRIPTION
       mqtt_client.py is a dedicated client module that handles message transmission and reception via an MQTT
       broker (mosquitto) in oneM2M-compliant format. It supports operations such as AE, CNT, and CIN creation.
       It is mainly used by sensor simulators and can communicate with tinyIoT or other oneM2M-compatible CSEs.

CLASS
       MqttOneM2MClient(broker, port, origin, cse_csi, cse_rn="TinyIoT")
              Initializes an object with broker address, port, origin identifier, and CSE-ID. Request and response
              topics are set according to the oneM2M format.

METHODS
       connect()
              Connects to the MQTT broker and subscribes to the response topic. Returns True on success, False on
              failure.

       disconnect()
              Terminates the MQTT connection and stops the loop.

       create_ae(ae_name)
              Sends a request to create an AE (Application Entity). Continues without error if already existing.
              Returns True or False depending on result.

       create_cnt(ae_name, cnt_name)
              Creates a CNT (Container) under the given AE. Ignores duplicate creation.

       send_cin(ae_name, cnt_name, value)
              Sends a ContentInstance (CIN) to the specified container. Value is sent as a string in oneM2M format.

INTERNAL LOGIC
       - All requests are sent via the internal _send_request() function with UUID-based request IDs (rqi).
       - Responses are processed through the response_received event and the on_message callback.
       - Requests are considered timed out if no response is received within 5 seconds.
       - Response codes (rsc) are checked according to oneM2M standards (e.g., 2001: created, 4105: already exists).

TOPICS
       Request Topic:
              /oneM2M/req/{origin}/{cse_id}/json

       Response Topic:
              /oneM2M/resp/{origin}/{cse_id}/json

DEPENDENCIES
       - paho-mqtt
       - json
       - threading
       - uuid

USAGE EXAMPLE
       mqtt = MqttOneM2MClient("localhost", 1883, "Sensor01", "TinyIoT")
       mqtt.connect()
       mqtt.create_ae("Sensor01")
       mqtt.create_cnt("Sensor01", "temperature")
       mqtt.send_cin("Sensor01", "temperature", "23.5")
       mqtt.disconnect()
